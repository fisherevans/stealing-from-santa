# Stealing From Santa

This is a silly little game made to be used as part of an escape room.

A screen was setup in one room, and a wireless set of arrow keys were in another room. Players had to communicate and play as a team to get to the end of the game. The goal for the escape room was to find out the high score, which you could only get by getting to the end of the game. The high score was a lock combo.
